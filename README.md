# terraform-plus-ansible
A repository demonstrating the seamless integration of Terraform and Ansible for automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

### Features:
Terraform: Automate the creation of cloud infrastructure (e.g., VMs, networks, security groups) with reusable and scalable IaC modules.
Ansible: Configure, manage, and deploy software to provisioned resources using a declarative approach.
Integration: Utilize Terraform to set up infrastructure and Ansible to configure and deploy applications in a unified workflow.
Scalability: Designed for managing both small and large-scale environments.
### Use Cases:
Provisioning cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) with Terraform.
Applying configurations like installing packages, setting up services, or deploying applications with Ansible.
Automating DevOps workflows with a combined Terraform-Ansible pipeline.
### Getting Started:
Clone the repository.
Set up your cloud provider credentials.
Define infrastructure resources using Terraform files.
Configure Ansible playbooks for post-provisioning tasks.
Run the pipeline to deploy and configure your environment end-to-end.
### Prerequisites:
Terraform 1.x or later.
Ansible 2.9 or later.
Cloud provider CLI (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, etc.) if applicable.
